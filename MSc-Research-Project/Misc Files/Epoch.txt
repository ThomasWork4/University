Epoching 

Dataset should include STIM channels that recorded electrical signals sent from the stimulus delivery computer as squarewave pulses
These pulses are used to mark experimental events

MNE couldn't find any STIM channels but the raw object has annotations. 

So instead of mne.find_events I'm going to use mne.events_from_annotations

After plotting the events I visualized them. Obviously, it doesn't look great but it was more for me 
to see where the events were actually coming from in the recording.

Before epoching, I needed to make a reject_criteria. These are basically data quality constraints: I reject any epoch 
peak-to-peak signal amplitude is beyond reasonable limits for that channel type. 

I'm not exactly sure what "beyond reasonable limits" would be for our dataset bearing in mind these values have been 
taken from the demonstration which is a completely different dataset.

Now I epoch the data given my events by stipulating a start and end time. Although it doesn't seem to work in seconds.
