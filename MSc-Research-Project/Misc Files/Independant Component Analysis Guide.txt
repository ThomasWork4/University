ICA Process

1. Data is scaled to unit variance and whitened using principal componenent analysis
   this is a two stage process:
	i) Data must be pre-whitened to deal with different units (Volts for EEG Tesla for MEG)
	   The data is scaled using the standard deviation across all channels
	ii) Pre-whitened data is then decomposed using PCA (Principal component analysis)

2. The results from the principal component analysis are then passed to the ICA algorithm (number specified by n_components)

3. We must then visualize the independant components and exclude any that capture artifacts that we want to repair 

5. We can then reconstruct the sensor signal using ICA objects apply method.
