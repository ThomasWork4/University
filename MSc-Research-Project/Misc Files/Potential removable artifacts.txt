101 in detecting noisy artifacts. If there is any doubt in your mind. Don't get rid of it. Removing useful brain 
signal data, is way worse then having a bit of extra noise to contend with. 

Remember that artifacts are numbered based on their variance in the data. Some artifacts
Once isolated can look very bad but in actual fact that dont have much effect on the 
variance in the data. Some people don't remove artifacts past IC20 or further in some cases

Potential Artifacts to remove (Look for obvious blinks, heart beats, 
and single electrode reliances where all the weights seem to be 0 except for one area)

Artifact 000 - Entirely reliant on single electrode. No ERP activity, and barely any
recognizable activity in ERP time domain chart

Same goes for - Artifact 001, artifact 015, artifact 018

Only doubt is that the power spectrum typically shows a 1/f shape. Starting high, curving 
and then plateuing. 

In all these artifacts, the power spectrum shows an expected shape? 

Artifact 002 - Could be a blink, very anterior weight distribution, 
ERP has small segments that could represent blinks. Also, the ERP time domain
chart doesn't display the typical updown spikes of brain activity

Artifact 003 - Could also be a blink, but less likely then artifact 2. 
Still shows signs (anterior weight distribution, also blinks in ERP representation)
That being said, the ERP representation shows too many blink indicators to be sure. 

Artifact 021, 031, 035 - Could be EMG (muscular). Power spectrum, moves up before taking the usual 1/f shape
