abstract = {Background
Advances in human neuroimaging has enabled us to study functional connections among various brain regions in pain states. Despite a wealth of studies at high anatomic resolution, the exact neural signals for the timing of pain remain little known. Identifying the onset of pain signals from distributed cortical circuits may reveal the temporal dynamics of pain responses and subsequently provide important feedback for closed-loop neuromodulation for pain.
New method
Here we developed an unsupervised learning method for sequential detection of acute pain signals based on multichannel human EEG recordings. Following EEG source localization, we used a state-space model (SSM) to detect the onset of acute pain signals based on the localized regions of interest (ROIs).
Results
We validated the SSM-based detection strategy using two human EEG datasets, including one public EEG recordings of 50 subjects. We found that the detection accuracy varied across tested subjects and detection methods. We also demonstrated the feasibility for cross-subject and cross-modality prediction of detecting the acute pain signals.
Comparison with existing methods
In contrast to the batch supervised learning analysis based on a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, the unsupervised learning method requires fewer number of training trials in the online experiment, and shows comparable or improved performance than the supervised method.
Conclusions
Our unsupervised SSM-based method combined with EEG source localization showed robust performance in detecting the onset of acute pain signals.}

              noxious heat stimuli and recorded brain activity using
              electroencephalography (EEG) in humans. Multilevel mediation
              analysis reveals that each pain dimension is subserved by a
              distinct pattern of EEG responses and, conversely, that each EEG
              response differentially contributes to the different dimensions
              of pain. In particular, the translation of noxious stimuli into
              autonomic and motor responses involved the earliest N1 wave,
              whereas pain perception was mediated by later N2 and P2 waves.
              Gamma oscillations mediated motor responses rather than pain
              perception. These findings represent progress towards a

  abstract = "Background: The International 10-20 system for EEG electrode
              placement is increasingly applied for the positioning of
              transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in cognitive neuroscience
              and in psychiatric treatment studies. The crucial issue in TMS
              studies remains the reliable positioning of the coil above the
              skull for targeting a desired cortex region. In order to asses
              the precision of the 10-20 system for this purpose, we tested its
              projections onto the underlying cortex by using neuronavigation.
              Methods: In 21 subjects, the 10-20 positions F3, F4, T3, TP3, and
              P3, as determined by a 10-20 positioning cap, were targeted
              stereotactically. The corresponding individual anatomical sites
              were identified in the Talairach atlas. Results: The main
              targeted regions were: for F3 Brodmann areas (BA) 8/9 within the
              dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, for T3 BA 22/42 on the superior
              temporal gyrus, for TP3 BA 40/39 in the area of the supramarginal
              and angular gyrus, and for P3 BA 7/40 on the inferior parietal
              lobe. However, in about 10\% of the measurements adjacent and
              possibly functionally distinct BAs were reached. The ranges were
              mainly below 20 mm. Conclusion: Using the 10-20 system for TMS
              positioning is applicable at low cost and may reach desired
              cortex regions reliably on a larger scale level. For finer
              grained positioning, possible interindividual differences, and
              therefore the application of neuroimaging based methods, are to
              be considered.",

ABSTRACT = {This paper investigates the use of an electroencephalogram (EEG) signal to classify a subject’s stress level while using virtual reality (VR). For this purpose, we designed an acquisition protocol based on alternating relaxing and stressful scenes in the form of a VR interactive simulation, accompanied by an EEG headset to monitor the subject’s psycho-physical condition. Relaxation scenes were developed based on scenarios created for psychotherapy treatment utilizing bilateral stimulation, while the Stroop test worked as a stressor. The experiment was conducted on a group of 28 healthy adult volunteers (office workers), participating in a VR session. Subjects’ EEG signal was continuously monitored using the EMOTIV EPOC Flex wireless EEG head cap system. After the session, volunteers were asked to re-fill questionnaires regarding the current stress level and mood. Then, we classified the stress level using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and compared the classification performance with conventional machine learning algorithms. The best results were obtained considering all brain waves (96.42%) with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers.},

abstract = {Recent research proposed that the slowing of individual alpha frequency (IAF) could be an objective marker of pain. However, it is unclear whether this research can fully address the requirements of specificity and sensitivity of IAF to the pain experience. Here, we sought to develop a robust methodology for assessing the specificity of the relationship between alpha oscillations and acute tonic pain in healthy individuals. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) of 36 volunteers during consecutive 5-minute sessions of painful hot water immersion, innocuous warm water immersion and aversive, non-painful auditory stimulus, matched by unpleasantness to the painful condition. Participants rated stimulus unpleasantness throughout each condition. We isolated two regions of the scalp displaying peak alpha activity across participants: centro-parietal (CP) and parieto-occipital (PO) ROI. In line with previous research our findings revealed decreased IAF during hot compared with warm stimulation, however the effect was not specific for pain as we found no difference between hot and sound in the CP ROI (compared to baseline). In contrast, the PO ROI reported the same pattern of differences, but their direction was opposite to the CP in that this ROI revealed faster frequency during hot condition than controls. Finally, we show that IAF in both ROIs did not mediate the relationship between the experimental manipulation and the affective experience. Altogether, these findings emphasize the importance of a robust methodological and analytical design to disclose the functional role of alpha oscillations during affective processing. Likewise, they suggest the absence of a causal role of IAF in the generation of acute pain experience in healthy individuals.}

        abstract = {One of the seminal findings of cognitive neuroscience is that the power of occipital alpha-band ({\texttt{\char126}} 10 Hz) brain waves is increased when peoples? eyes are closed, rather than open. This has encouraged the view that alpha oscillations are a default dynamic, to which the visual brain returns in the absence of input. Accordingly, we might be unable to increase the power of alpha oscillations when the eyes are closed, above the level that would normally ensue when people close their eyes. Here we report counter evidence. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to record brain activity when people had their eyes open and closed, both before and after they had adapted to radial motion. The increase in alpha power when people closed their eyes was increased by prior adaptation to a broad range of radial motion speeds. This effect was greatest for 10 Hz motion, but robust for other frequencies (and especially 7.5 Hz). This discredits a persistent entrainment of activity at the adaptation frequency as an explanation for our findings. Our data show that the power of occipital alpha-band brain waves can be increased by motion sensitive visual processes that persist when the eyes are closed. Consequently, we suggest that the power of these brain waves is, at least in part, an index of the degree to which visual brain activity is being subjected to inhibition. This is increased when people close their eyes, but can be even further increased by pre-adaptation to radial motion.}

abstract = {Previously, modulations in power of neuronal oscillations have been functionally linked to sensory, motor and cognitive operations. Such links are commonly established by relating the power modulations to specific target variables such as reaction times or task ratings. Consequently, the resulting spatio-spectral representation is subjected to neurophysiological interpretation. As an alternative, independent component analysis (ICA) or alternative decomposition methods can be applied and the power of the components may be related to the target variable. In this paper we show that these standard approaches are suboptimal as the first does not take into account the superposition of many sources due to volume conduction, while the second is unable to exploit available information about the target variable. To improve upon these approaches we introduce a novel (supervised) source separation framework called Source Power Comodulation (SPoC). SPoC makes use of the target variable in the decomposition process in order to give preference to components whose power comodulates with the target variable. We present two algorithms that implement the SPoC approach. Using simulations with a realistic head model, we show that the SPoC algorithms are able extract neuronal components exhibiting high correlation of power with the target variable. In this task, the SPoC algorithms outperform other commonly used techniques that are based on the sensor data or ICA approaches. Furthermore, using real electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during an auditory steady state paradigm, we demonstrate the utility of the SPoC algorithms by extracting neuronal components exhibiting high correlation of power with the intensity of the auditory input. Taking into account the results of the simulations and real EEG recordings, we conclude that SPoC represents an adequate approach for the optimal extraction of neuronal components showing coupling of power with continuously changing behaviorally relevant parameters.}

To achieve this goal, scalp EEG data were recorded from 32 subjects under cold stimuli conditions. The proposed DFB-based ConvNets model is capable of classifying three classes of tonic pain: No pain, Moderate Pain, and Severe Pain. Firstly, the proposed method utilizes diverse frequency band-based inputs to learn temporal representations from different frequency bands of Electroencephalogram (EEG) which are expected to have more discriminative power. Then the derived features are concatenated to form a feature vector, which is fed into a fully-connected network for performing the classification task. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully discriminates the tonic cold pain states. To show the superiority of the DFB-based ConvNets classifier, we compare our results with the state-of-the-art classifiers and show it has a competitive classification accuracy (97.37\%). Moreover, these promising results may pave the way to use DFB-based ConvNets in clinical pain research.}
