	abstract = {Recent research has pointed to alpha brain oscillations as a potential clinical biomarker for sensitivity to pain. In particular, researchers claimed that the slowing of individual alpha frequency (IAF) could be an objective marker of pain during prolonged nociceptive stimulation. However, prolonged pain has been also associated with increased IAF. To date, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that IAF can be a neural marker of pain.The current study aimed at elucidating the conflicting findings by assessing the specificity of the relationship between brain alpha oscillations and tonic pain. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) on healthy volunteers during exposure to consecutive 5-minute sessions of painful hot water immersion, innocuous warm water immersion and an aversive, non-painful auditory stimulus, matched by unpleasantness to the painful condition. Participants rated stimulus unpleasantness throughout each condition. We also asked participants to sit still with eyes closed and eyes open right before and after the three experimental conditions in order to obtain a robust estimate of baseline alpha. Our findings revealed both increased and decreased IAF during tonic hot stimulation depending on the alpha range targeted (7-13 Hz vs. 8-10 Hz). In addition, they provide mild evidence for a negative relationship between IAF and the unpleasantness of the experience. Finally, we could not identify a difference between IAF during tonic hot temperature and during tonic auditory experience. Altogether, these findings emphasize a twofold frequency pattern (increase vs. decrease) for IAF during tonic thermal pain, thus indicating the need for robust methodological scrutiny of IAF as a neural marker of pain.},

abstract = {Background
Advances in human neuroimaging has enabled us to study functional connections among various brain regions in pain states. Despite a wealth of studies at high anatomic resolution, the exact neural signals for the timing of pain remain little known. Identifying the onset of pain signals from distributed cortical circuits may reveal the temporal dynamics of pain responses and subsequently provide important feedback for closed-loop neuromodulation for pain.
New method
Here we developed an unsupervised learning method for sequential detection of acute pain signals based on multichannel human EEG recordings. Following EEG source localization, we used a state-space model (SSM) to detect the onset of acute pain signals based on the localized regions of interest (ROIs).
Results
We validated the SSM-based detection strategy using two human EEG datasets, including one public EEG recordings of 50 subjects. We found that the detection accuracy varied across tested subjects and detection methods. We also demonstrated the feasibility for cross-subject and cross-modality prediction of detecting the acute pain signals.
Comparison with existing methods
In contrast to the batch supervised learning analysis based on a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, the unsupervised learning method requires fewer number of training trials in the online experiment, and shows comparable or improved performance than the supervised method.
Conclusions
Our unsupervised SSM-based method combined with EEG source localization showed robust performance in detecting the onset of acute pain signals.}

               OBJECTIVES: To replicate previous findings regarding
               electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern differences in a larger
               sample of patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) and chronic
               pain than previously studied, and examine associations between
               pain severity and EEG activity in a sample of patients with SCI
               and chronic pain. SETTING: USA. METHODS: EEG data were collected
               in an eyes-closed condition from 38 individuals with SCI and
               chronic pain, 16 individuals with SCI who did not have chronic
               pain and 28 healthy controls. Pain intensity experienced during
               the EEG assessment was assessed in the chronic pain group.
               Absolute and relative power in four frequency bands (delta,
               theta, alpha, and beta) were compared between the groups, and
               correlation coefficients between bandwidth activity and pain
               intensity in the pain group were computed. RESULTS: Previously
               identified activity pattern differences (that is, more theta and
               less alpha) in those with SCI and chronic pain versus
               individuals with SCI and no pain and healthy controls were
               largely replicated. However, few significant associations
               between pain severity and EEG activity measures activity were
               found, and those that were found (more alpha activity associated
               with more pain as measured from frontal electrode sites) was in
               a direction opposite than predicted. CONCLUSION: The findings
               indicate that certain EEG activity patterns may be associated
               with more pain or a vulnerability to experience chronic pain in
               persons with SCI. Research examining the extent to which changes
               in this EEG activity may result in pain relief is warranted.",

While this slowing may reflect pathological changes that occur during the chronification of pain, an alternative explanation is that healthy individuals with slower alpha oscillations are more sensitive to prolonged pain, and by extension, more susceptible to developing chronic pain. To test this hypothesis, we examined the relationship between the pain-free, resting alpha oscillation speed of healthy individuals and their sensitivity to two models of prolonged pain, Phasic Heat Pain and Capsaicin Heat Pain, at two visits separated by 8 weeks on average (n = 61 Visit 1, n = 46 Visit 2). We observed that the speed of an individual’s pain-free alpha oscillations was negatively correlated with sensitivity to both models and that this relationship was reliable across short (minutes) and long (weeks) timescales. Furthermore, the speed of pain-free alpha oscillations can successfully identify the most pain sensitive individuals, which we validated on data from a separate, independent study. These results suggest that alpha oscillation speed is a reliable biomarker of prolonged pain sensitivity with potential for prospectively identifying pain sensitivity in the clinic.}",

In the previous studies, the EEG signals are usually fed into the CNNs in the form of high-dimensional raw data. However, this approach makes it difficult to exploit the brain connectivity information that can be effective in describing the functional brain network and estimating the perceptual state of the user. We introduce a new classification system that utilizes brain connectivity with a CNN and validate its effectiveness via the emotional video classification by using three different types of connectivity measures. Furthermore, two data-driven methods to construct the connectivity matrix are proposed to maximize classification performance. Further analysis reveals that the level of concentration of the brain connectivity related to the emotional property of the target video is correlated with classification performance.}

               minimize the loss of important information embedded in the

               necessary to minimize the complexity of implementation, to
               reduce the cost of information processing, and to cancel the

              minutes, regions beyond the sensorimotor cortex, such as the

              conventional, millisecond-long EEG paradigms do not engage
              prefrontal regions. In the current study, we collected
              high-density EEG data during an experimental paradigm in which
              subjects experienced a 4-s, low- or high-intensity pain-eliciting

              gamma and theta power in a cortical region that included medial
              prefrontal cortex. Second, a decrease in lower beta power was
              associated with an increase in pain perception in a cortical
              region that included the contralateral sensorimotor cortex.
              Third, we used machine learning for automated classification of
              EEG data into low- and high-pain classes. Theta and gamma power
              in the medial prefrontal region and lower beta power in the
              contralateral sensorimotor region served as features for
              classification. We found a leave-one-out cross-validation
              accuracy of 89.58\%. The development of biological markers for
              pain states continues to gain traction in the literature, and our
              findings provide new information that advances this body of
              work.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY The development of a biological marker for
              pain continues to gain traction in literature. Our findings show
              that high- and low-pain perception in human subjects can be
              classified with 89\% accuracy using high-density EEG data from
              prefrontal cortex and contralateral sensorimotor cortex. Our
              approach represents a novel neurophysiological paradigm that
              advances the literature on biological markers for pain.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Most current electroencephalography (EEG)-based
              brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are based on machine learning
              algorithms. There is a large diversity of classifier types that
              are used in this field, as described in our 2007 review paper.
              Now, approximately ten years after this review publication, many
              new algorithms have been developed and tested to classify EEG
              signals in BCIs. The time is therefore ripe for an updated review
              of EEG classification algorithms for BCIs. APPROACH: We surveyed
              the BCI and machine learning literature from 2007 to 2017 to
              identify the new classification approaches that have been
              investigated to design BCIs. We synthesize these studies in order
              to present such algorithms, to report how they were used for
              BCIs, what were the outcomes, and to identify their pros and
              cons. MAIN RESULTS: We found that the recently designed
              classification algorithms for EEG-based BCIs can be divided into
              four main categories: adaptive classifiers, matrix and tensor
              classifiers, transfer learning and deep learning, plus a few
              other miscellaneous classifiers. Among these, adaptive
              classifiers were demonstrated to be generally superior to static
              ones, even with unsupervised adaptation. Transfer learning can
              also prove useful although the benefits of transfer learning
              remain unpredictable. Riemannian geometry-based methods have
              reached state-of-the-art performances on multiple BCI problems
              and deserve to be explored more thoroughly, along with
              tensor-based methods. Shrinkage linear discriminant analysis and
              random forests also appear particularly useful for small training
              samples settings. On the other hand, deep learning methods have
              not yet shown convincing improvement over state-of-the-art BCI
              methods. SIGNIFICANCE: This paper provides a comprehensive
              overview of the modern classification algorithms used in
              EEG-based BCIs, presents the principles of these methods and
              guidelines on when and how to use them. It also identifies a
              number of challenges to further advance EEG classification in
              BCI.",
